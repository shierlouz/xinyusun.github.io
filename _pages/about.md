About me

I am Xinyu Sun at the Master of Applied Statistics program in School of Management, Fudan University. Currently, I’m a research intern in Baidu(Shanghai). I completed my undergraduate studies in the Department of Mathematics at Nanjing University.

 

Research Interest
======
My current research interests lie in agentic reinforcement learning within large language models (LLMs), particularly focusing on multi-step planning, reward design, and entropy theorem. I am also interested in applying advanced mathematics and statistics to improve the theoretical foundations and performance of reinforcement learning algorithms.
