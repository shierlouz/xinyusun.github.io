## **Research Interests**

My current research interests lie in *agentic reinforcement learning* within large language models (LLMs), particularly focusing on **multi-step planning**, **reward design**, and **entropy theorem**.  
I am also interested in applying **advanced mathematics and statistics** to improve the theoretical foundations and performance of reinforcement learning algorithms.
